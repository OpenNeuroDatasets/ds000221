The MPI-Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body dataset contains MRI and behavioral data from 318 participants. Datasets for all participants include at least a structural quantitative T1-weighted image and a single 15-minute eyes-open resting-state fMRI session.
 
The participants took part in one or two extended protocols: Leipzig Mind-Body-Brain Interactions (LEMON) and Neuroanatomy & Connectivity Protocol (N&C). The data from LEMON protocol is included in the ‘ses-01’ subfolder; the data from N&C protocol in ‘ses-02’ subfolder.

LEMON focuses on structural imaging. 228 participants were scanned.  In addition to the quantitative T1-weighted image, the participants also have a structural T2-weighted image (226 participants), a diffusion-weighted image with 64 directions (228) and a 15-minute eyes-open resting-state session (228). New imaging sequences were introduced into the LEMON protocol after data acquisition for approximately 110 participants. Before the change, a low-resolution 2D FLAIR images were acquired for clinical purposes (110). After the change, 2D FLAIR was replaced with high-resolution 3D FLAIR (117). The second addition was the acquisition of gradient-echo images (112) that can be used for Susceptibility-Weighted Imaging (SWI) and Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM). 

The N&C protocol focuses on resting-state fMRI data. 199 participants were scanned with this protocol; 109 participants also took part in the LEMON protocol. Structural data was not acquired for the overlapping LEMON participants. For the unique N&C participants, only a T1-weighted and a low-resolution FLAIR image were acquired. Four 15-minute runs of eyes-open resting-state are the main component of N&C; they are complete for 194 participants, three participants have 3 runs, one participant has 2 runs and one participant has a single run. Due to a bug in multiband sequence used in this protocol, the echo time for N&C resting-state is longer than in LEMON — 39.4 ms vs 30 ms. 

Forty-five participants have complete imaging data: quantitative T1-weighted, T2-weighted, high-resolution 3D FLAIR, DWI, GRE and 75 minutes of resting-state. Both gradient-echo and spin-echo field maps are available in both datasets for all EPI-based sequences (rsfMRI and DWI). 

Extensive behavioral data was acquired in both protocols. They include trait and state questionnaires, as well as behavioral tasks. Here we only list the tasks; more extenstive descriptions are available in the manuscripts.
